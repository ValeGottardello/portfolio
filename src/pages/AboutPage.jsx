                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a Software Engineer who completed a 12-week immersive course at General Assembly in May 2023. With four years of experience in the legal field, followed by three years working in the fitness industry as a Head Coach-Manager and pursuing a full-time professional athlete career, I made the decision to explore new horizons. This led me to embark on a transformative journey of relocation abroad, which propelled me into an exciting career path in the field of software engineering.

                        With a strong dedication to my professional growth, nurtured by my experience in sports, I am driven to make a significant impact in the field of software engineering. I am always fully prepared to face challenges head-on.
